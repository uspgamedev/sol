=== Summer of LÖVE2D ===

SoL is a minimalistic 2D game framework built upon the game engine LÖVE2D. Which means LÖVE2D is
required to run it. You can get it on:

  www.love2d.org

To run the framework, either enter the command:

  $ love game

In a prompt terminal from this directory, or use the sublime-text editor to open the project and
press CTRL+B.

To start understanding how to use it, I recommend reading the game/samplescene.lua file.
